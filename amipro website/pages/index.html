        <p> Zero Commission? Really? </p>
      </div>
      <div class= text>
        <p> Yes. Absolutely. If you list your home with us, you will pay us no commission upon sale.  If you buy a home with us, we will give the entire commission back to you.  </p>
      </div> 
      <div class= title>
        <p> How's That Possible? </p>
      </div>
      <div class= text>
        <p> We provide you with all the tools needed to buy or sell a home.  As a seller, you can create a professional looking listing that will be posted on your state's multiple listing service website.  As a buyer, you can search through the active listings on your state's listing service, and contact the seller's agent for any homes that you are interested in.  In short, you do the legwork, and you keep all of the commission.</p>

        <p> What if I Know Nothing About Buying or Selling a Home? </p>
      </div>
      <div class= text>
        <p> Not to worry.  Our easy-to-use platform provides you with checklists, reminders, and guidance to make the process easy.  We also connect you with home buying professionals to help you close the transaction, such as attorneys, home inspectors, photographers, and more.  And if you have a question at any time, you can call our office to speak with an agent. </p>
