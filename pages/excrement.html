        <p> Zero Commission?</p>
      </div>
      <div class= text>
        <p> Absolutely. If you list your home with us you will pay us no commission upon sale, provided you engage our real estate professionals to prepare for your the closing.  Similarly, if you buy a home with us, we will give the entire commission back to you, provided you enlist our real estate professionals.  Our team of real estate professionals is qualified, experienced, and their services are offered at competitive rates.  Of course, you do not have to hire our real estate professionals, but in that case we would charge you a flat commission of $999 upon closing in order to cover our costs.</p>

        <p> How Does It Work? </p>
      </div>
      <div class= text>
        <p> We provide you with all the tools needed to buy or sell a home.  As a seller, you can create a professional looking listing that will be posted on your state's multiple listing service website.  As a buyer, you can search through the active listings on your state's listing service, and contact the seller's agent for any homes that you are interested in.  In short, you do the legwork, and you keep all of the commission.</p>
